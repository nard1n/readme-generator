    ## Description
    [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD-2-Clause-yellow.svg)]
    This is a simple Node.JS CLI app that helps a user generate a README.md file for their project repositories. It prompts the user to enter essential information about their repository, such as: title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. It will display all of the information in a professional manner in separated sections along with a table of contents containing links to corresponding sections. It also includes a Questions section with a link to Github profile and an email address based on user input
